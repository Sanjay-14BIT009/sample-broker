Sample broker that handles all message types and operates in both
wholesale and retail markets.

This version runs as a server component. To use it, you need to modify
server-main/pom.xml to load and start it. The modified version is
included in this module as server-main-pom.xml. Just back up the
original server-main/pom.xml and replace it with the modified
version. If you are using Eclipse/STS and have already loaded up the
sample-broker project, it should be enough to then update the maven
project configuration in server-main. Otherwise, you will probably
need to do 'mvn install' on it before the server will see it.

To run a simulation with this broker, you will need to start the
server with a script file containing at least the line

Broker parameters are currently hardcoded; there is currently no easy
way to integrate configuration of a module like this into the server
config, but this problem should be solved by issue #462.
